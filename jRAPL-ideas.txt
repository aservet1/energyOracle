jrapl ideas:
	EnergySample.getNumSockets() instead of ArchSpec.NUM_SOCKETS
	
make Diff.between() take abstract samples -- think about if you want to enforce strictly using this class for the difference between two raw EnergyStats stamps

EnergySample.dumpFormatHeader(), or overloaded dump where you ask for the header one line above the dump
