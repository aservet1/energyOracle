jrapl ideas:
	EnergySample.getNumSockets() instead of ArchSpec.NUM_SOCKETS
	
	make Diff.between() take abstract samples -- think about if you want to enforce strictly using this class for the difference between two raw EnergyStats stamps

	EnergySample.dumpFormatHeader(), or overloaded dump where you ask for the header one line above the dump

	EnergySample.dumps() vs EnergySample.loads()







report bug:
	it looks like the add subplot function says that it returns none here but it doesnt but on their actual page website thing it works. the problems probably coming from intellisense
